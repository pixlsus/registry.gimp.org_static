######### WHAT IT DOES
Sets mode and and ring buttons for Wacom Intuos 5 (and probably other?) tablets.  
Only tested on opensuse 12.3 with Intuos5 touch m

Requires xsetwacom and libnotify-tools.  Tested on OpenSuSE 12.3.  Reimplementation of 
touchring-toggle.sh by  Favux ... <favux.is <at> gmail.com> 
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.wacom/6703


Not much use on its own.   Must bind middle touchring button to a key sequence, and, in gimp, 
bind that key sequence to this plugin.


********** Issue with LEDs 
By default the LEDs on the tablet need root permisisons to set/write 
so the status LED can only be changed if changes have been made when booting to 
make the tablet LEDs user writable 

Quoting from Favux's original script:
## To allow script to select mode status LEDs edit rc.local to change root
## only permissions on the sysfs status_led0_select file:
##   gksudo gedit /etc/rc.local
## Add the following comment and command (before 'exit 0'):
##   # Change permissions on status_led0_select file so being root isn't
##   # required to switch Wacom touch ring mode status LEDs.
##   /bin/chmod 666 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/wacom_led/status_led0_select
##
## Intuos - status_led0_select file = the left (only) ring status LEDs.
## Cintiq - status_led1_select = the left ring; status_led0_select =
## the right ring status LEDs.  Same for the touchstrips.

For OpenSuSE:
there is presumably some way to do this so that it is set on each reboot
however, I don't know. 
apparently, something to do with making a udev rule:

Make a file called /etc/udev/rules.d/wacom_permissions.sh with the following:
#!/bin/bash
/bin/chmod 666 /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/wacom_led/status_led0_select
make sure it's executable 

make a file called 99-wacom-intuos.rules with the line:
ACTION=="add|change", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ATTR{idVendor}=="056a",  RUN+="/etc/udev/rules.d/wacom_permissions.sh"

I also have ATTR{idProduct}=="0027", in my rule, but that'll only work if you have the same model
Find vendor and product ids using lsusb:
Bus 003 Device 003: ID 056a:0027 Wacom Co., Ltd Intuos5 touch M
056a is the vendor id
0027 is the product id

NB: the 99-wacom-intuos.rules don't work if the tablet is plugged in at power up 
(apparently because the file system is read only until boot is completed).  
Unplug and reconnect is my current workaround. 
It is also possible for root to trigger a change action using udevadm from a script - perhaps on login?


#### History
Version: 1.20130515
converted to gimpplugin.plugin structure
this allows initialisation at start up to last used mode
